## First Release (2019/04/04)

This project is to make XBOX 360 / XBOX One controller usable in common with Windows, OSX and Linux.  
If you can share this result, your Unity development efficiency will also increase.  
It's still in development, so if you have a bug or lack of support, we'll be waiting for your pull request.
